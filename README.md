### Hello 🤚

In this app, you can see the latest movies and series of the day and get information about them.  
It is also possible to search. 😎

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 14 is used for the front-end and information is received from the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

### 📌 More Challenges and Explanations

This project had many challenges for me,  
such as rendering and changing the content on the search page or preloading some data.  
During this project, I got acquainted with the new `swr` package and improved my understanding of SSR and SSG.
